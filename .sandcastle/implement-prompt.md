# TASK

Fix issue #{{ISSUE_NUMBER}}: {{ISSUE_TITLE}}

Pull in the issue using `gh issue view {{ISSUE_NUMBER}} --json number,title,body,labels,comments,state,author`. If it has a parent PRD, pull that in the same way. (The `--json` form avoids a GitHub `projectItems` permission error on tokens without project scope.)

Only work on the issue specified.

Work on branch {{BRANCH}}. Make commits and run tests. Do NOT push the branch, open a PR, or close the issue — a separate agent handles PR creation, and the merged PR closes the issue automatically.

# CONTEXT

Here are the last 10 commits:

<recent-commits>

!`git log -n 10 --format="%H%n%ad%n%B---" --date=short`

</recent-commits>

# EXPLORATION

Explore the repo and fill your context window with relevant information that will allow you to complete the task.

Pay extra attention to test files that touch the relevant parts of the code.

# EXECUTION

If applicable, use RGR to complete the task.

1. RED: write one test
2. GREEN: write the implementation to pass that test
3. REPEAT until done
4. REFACTOR the code

# FEEDBACK LOOPS

Before committing, run `bun run ci` to ensure typecheck, tests, and lint all pass.

# COMMIT

Make a git commit. The commit message must:

1. Start with `RALPH:` prefix
2. Include task completed + PRD reference
3. Key decisions made
4. Files changed
5. Blockers or notes for next iteration

Keep it concise.

# THE ISSUE

If the task is not complete, leave a comment on the GitHub issue with what was done.

Do not close the issue — the merged PR will close it automatically via `Closes #N`.

Once complete, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>.

# FINAL RULES

ONLY WORK ON A SINGLE TASK.
